## Bugs
- Getting while loop to work correctly. First, I took a couple of days away from the code. Next I rewrote this several times until I got it right.

- When I deployed my code it did not deploy correctly.  I had to redo pip3 line due to a typo on that line and it was right immediately after that


## Testing

    - Given invalid inputs such as a number and a repeat of previous letter used.
    - Tested in my local terminal as well as on Heroku.
