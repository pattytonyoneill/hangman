## Bugs
- Getting while loop to work correctly. First, I took a couple of days away from the code. Next I rewrote this several times until I got it right.

- When I deployed my code it did not deploy correctly.  I had to redo pip3 line due to a typo on that line and it was right immediately after that

- When I added a clear message my welcome message was not showing.  I fixed this by putting clear under individual statements in the code so it clears.

- When I added an update_game function it was just ending game instead of asking if you want to play again.  I just reworked code until I fixed it.

- When I added the handle_input function it was repeating over and over "You have 9 lives left and you have used these letters:" 

- 


## Testing

- I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
    - Given invalid inputs such as a number and a repeat of previous letter used.
    - Tested in my local terminal as well as on Heroku.
